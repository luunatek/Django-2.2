These files are:
- The outer mysite/ root directory is just a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; 
you can rename it to anything you like.

- manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. 

- The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python 
package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).

- mysite/__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. 

- mysite/settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project.

- mysite/urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. 

- mysite/wsgi.py: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.
